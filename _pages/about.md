I'm a journalist based in Richmond, Virginia, and I currently work as a data reporter at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Much of my work is on the [education beat](https://richmond.com/news/local/education/23-va-school-districts-have-taken-books-off-shelves-in-past-two-years/article_7ce0f31d-dbab-55f0-9576-cb4ae93e14eb.html), but I also cover stories in several other subject areas, like [the housing market](https://richmond.com/news/local/first-time-homebuyers-feel-squeezed-out-as-richmond-housing-market-stays-hot/article_934f3665-dec5-5c10-af92-c870dd5c2a7a.html) and [the opioid crisis](https://richmond.com/news/local/richmond-is-virginias-overdose-capital-nine-of-10-fatal-overdoses-in-the-city-involve-fentanyl/article_a3dce63b-63fc-5fe1-ba57-9796e68fe004.html).

Before joining the Times-Dispatch staff, I was part of the reporting team behind the [Pandora Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/), an investigation into global financial corruption led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. I helped analyze a trove of 12 million leaked documents containing information on offshore financial holdings by powerful figures including world leaders and prominent politicians, and I reported on [the shell companies owned by famous athletes and entertainers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/shakira-sachin-julio-celebrities-use-offshore/).

I grew up in the greatest city on the planet — New Orleans, Louisiana — and have a master's degree in journalism from the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism and a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia. When I'm not reporting, I host a podcast called [It's Pretty OK](https://prettyokpod.com), play the guitar and sing, and enjoy reading and listening to my record collection.
