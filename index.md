**Hi, I'm Sean.**

I'm a journalist based in Richmond, Virginia. I work as a news editor at [VPM News](vpm.org){:target="_blank"}, helping manage our daily coverage of Central Virginia for web, radio and other digital platforms — including the Morning Monitor newsletter. I spend most of my time editing my colleagues' work, but I occasionally step off the bench to do some reporting myself; you might have seen my reporting in the runup to the 2024 election on Richmond City Council candidate Tavares Floyd — whose false claims about [being a lawyer](https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-10-21/richmond-6th-district-city-council-tavares-floyd-lawyer-ceo){:target="_blank"} and [owning a funeral home](https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-10-22/tavares-floyd-mcclenny-watkins-funeral-richmond){:target="_blank"} shed light on the fact that no city official seems to be responsible for [vetting the truthfulness of local campaign finance reports](https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-11-01/keith-balmer-colette-mceachin-tavares-floyd-campaign-finance-investigation){:target="_blank"}.

Before joining VPM News, I covered a variety of topics through a data-driven lens for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. I won Virginia Press Association awards for data journalism in 2022 (for my education reporting, including [book bans](https://web.archive.org/web/20220508020653/https://richmond.com/news/local/education/23-va-school-districts-have-taken-books-off-shelves-in-past-two-years/article_7ce0f31d-dbab-55f0-9576-cb4ae93e14eb.html){:target="_blank"}, [aging school buildings](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225184136/https://richmond.com/news/local/impasse-over-rebuilding-george-wythe-highlights-richmonds-deteriorating-school-buildings/article_80901f2e-8ee2-5030-bfc7-55e34ed616eb.html){:target="_blank"} and [district spending](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401170659/https://richmond.com/news/local/education/on-per-pupil-funding-chesterfield-ranks-last-among-large-va-school-systems/article_01c6f413-56f8-5256-94c7-cbd5122ccade.html){:target="_blank"}) and 2023 (for an analysis of the [structural condition of Virginia's bridges](https://web.archive.org/web/20230520081258/https://richmond.com/news/local/virginia-dept-of-transportation-richmond-area-bridges-structurally-deficient/article_c567cf0a-eff1-11ed-b3f6-aba37bb4a09a.html){:target="_blank"}).

Prior to that, I was part of the reporting team behind the [Pandora Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/){:target="_blank"}, an investigation into global financial corruption led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. I helped analyze a trove of 12 million leaked documents containing information on offshore financial holdings by powerful figures including world leaders and prominent politicians, and I reported on [the shell companies owned by famous athletes and entertainers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/shakira-sachin-julio-celebrities-use-offshore/){:target="_blank"}.

I grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana and have a master's degree in journalism from the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism and a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia. I used to host a podcast called [It's Pretty OK](https://prettyokpod.com){:target="_blank"} and a late-night rock show on WTJU in Charlottesville, Virginia.
